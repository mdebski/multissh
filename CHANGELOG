little fix when passing options from multissh to multissh.py
@list align columns
count connected/disconn in @list
@-- -> drop all disconnected
more operations ignore disconnected hosts (caused python exceptions earlier)
-x option for treating ranges as hex

-- 0.2 --
multissh is run with rlwrap or ledit if they are present on the system
@list shows state (connected/disconnected)
do not execute on inactive/missing session
